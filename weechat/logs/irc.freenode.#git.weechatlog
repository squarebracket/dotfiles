2016-02-01 13:22:59	ashka	hi, I have a question about something I don't understand with rebasing: when I want to rebase from develop to master I do git rebase -i, but when I do that I see commits that I have already rebased on my last rebase, why is that ?
2016-02-01 13:23:41	Seveas	ashka: because until the commits are merged into master, you'll need to keep rebasing them.

2016-02-01 13:28:00	Seveas	it's better to rebase -i while on develop, then you can just do merge --ff-only on master and both master and develop would be at the same commit.

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.
