2015-11-12 15:32:24	kylo	we should document what can run on the server ... at least for facter
2015-11-12 15:32:58	Speedr	Ya but wouldn't you already have all the facts ahead of time and you're just trying to grab them from the hash?
2015-11-12 15:33:54	Speedr	You just want the value from what's provided, not to call facter again, right?
2015-11-12 15:34:28	kylo	right
2015-11-12 15:34:48	Speedr	not that I know the method or class that provides that :)
2015-11-12 15:35:17	kylo	i'm wondering if that code actually works correctly in a mixed redhat/deb env

2015-11-12 15:36:20	Speedr	a way to test is load it up with a puts line in the autorequire so you can see what happens, have the master be centos and client debian or something and see what it grabs? :P

2015-11-12 15:36:48	kylo	yeah
2015-11-12 15:36:50	Speedr	or pry inside any time and just test facter
2015-11-12 15:36:57	Speedr	s/time/type
2015-11-12 15:42:40	_ody	That is a completely different problem though.  The current problem is just that the [] method does not exist.
2015-11-12 15:43:39	MichaelSmith	Yes, that was a conscious for Facter running in Puppetserver that we need to document better.
2015-11-12 15:44:02	Speedr	I understand that, was just throwing my cents in regarding the current spot and all the stuff you can test while in pry at that point to check the [] method and stuff, you guys get to deal with the api issues :)
2015-11-12 15:44:16	MichaelSmith	Feel free to file a ticket on it; this use-case doesn't seem compelling, because it doesn't seem like it's needed on the server. But it may be worth adding.

2015-11-12 16:00:28	jyaworski	Hey all. I ran into build failures here: https://travis-ci.org/puppet-community/puppet-archive/jobs/90815233 I noticed https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3796 exists, but it looks like nothing came out of it. I’m using 3.8.4.
2015-11-12 16:06:32	MichaelSmith	Where is 'safe_yaml' coming from?
2015-11-12 16:08:05	jyaworski	It looks like puppet itself bundles it.
2015-11-12 16:09:25	MichaelSmith	Not any time recently that I see... I must be overlooking something.
2015-11-12 16:10:52	MichaelSmith	PUPPET_VERSION="~> 4.0", I guess that's being ignored?
2015-11-12 16:11:18	MichaelSmith	Ah, safe_yaml was in 3.8.4. Got really off-track because I thought it was 4.0
2015-11-12 16:11:52	MichaelSmith	Yeah, no one's fixed up Puppet 3.x for Ruby 2.2
2015-11-12 16:13:47	jyaworski	Right, that’s because I was silly and referenced PUPPET_VERSION wrong on that run. I fixed it in subsequent runs. :/

2015-11-13 11:34:06	FriedBob	electrical: Maybe you should add a test for that. ;)
2015-11-13 11:34:12	electrical	hehe
2015-11-13 11:35:14	FriedBob	Looks like we only wrote 25 of the 79 modules we use, so that's good. Only 24 modules to write tests for, and the bulk of that I will do with some shell script copypasta.
2015-11-13 11:38:23	electrical	hehe okay. still surprised you had to build so many though

2015-11-13 16:56:38	einheber	hola... getting an execution error from my puppet provider, but when I run the actual command it doesn't error.  maybe has something to do with quoting?  here are the details:
2015-11-13 16:56:50	einheber	# puppet apply -e 'nis {"current": securenets => {"a.foo.com" => "1.2.3.4", "b.foo.com" => "2.3.4.6"} }'
2015-11-13 16:57:17	einheber	Error: /Stage[main]/Main/Nis[current]/securenets: change from {"b.foo.com"=>"2.3.4.5", "a.foo.com"=>"1.2.3.4"} to {"a.foo.com"=>"1.2.3.4", "b.foo.com"=>"2.3.4.6"} failed: Execution of '/usr/sbin/svccfg -s svc:/network/nis/domain setprop config/securenets = astring:  '("a.foo.com 1.2.3.4", "b.foo.com 2.3.4.6")'' returned 1: svccfg: Syntax error.
2015-11-13 16:57:31	einheber	# /usr/sbin/svccfg -s svc:/network/nis/domain setprop config/securenets = astring:  '("a.foo.com 1.2.3.4", "b.foo.com 2.3.4.6")'
2015-11-13 16:57:32	einheber	# echo $?
2015-11-13 16:57:32	einheber	0
2015-11-13 16:59:31	einheber	so it appears the command is being formulated properly as I can pick it up and paste it into the shell without error... but it is erroring when executing from puppet with this line: svccfg("-s", Domain_fmri, "setprop", "config/securenets = astring: ", val)
2015-11-13 17:04:50	einheber	oh... I see... it appears to be how I'm combining those arguments in the call.

2015-11-14 09:35:48	daenney	Beaker::Hypervisor, found some vagrant boxes to create
2015-11-14 09:36:12	daenney	Or well, hmm, that could be interpreted multiple ways
2015-11-14 09:36:26	daenney	But the error seems to be: #<RuntimeError: Failed to exec 'vagrant destroy --force'. Error was /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require': cannot load such file -- bundler/setup (LoadError)
2015-11-14 09:36:42	daenney	I think it can't find bundler
2015-11-14 09:37:00	daenney	So I would do a `(sudo) gem install bundler` and take it from there
2015-11-14 09:37:50	daenney	Though it's weird since bundle exec worked just fine :/

2015-11-14 09:52:40	daenney	You might want to `bundle update` first and then try again

2015-11-16 12:27:24	Speedr	rnelson0: with the only function method of doing it, doesn't args need to be wrapped in [ ] if it's not an array to begin with during the call?
2015-11-16 12:28:38	rnelson0	I don't know, but it wouldn't help since hiera_hash just fail()s
2015-11-16 12:28:40	Speedr	only = old... too early
2015-11-16 12:28:50	rnelson0	gotta get past that part and call the right function, first.
2015-11-16 12:31:14	Speedr	ya :) I know in that second post they discussed how they fixed the inability to call puppet 3.x functions(parser/functions) with call_function I'm wondering if that caused issues for functions that exist in both spots or not...
2015-11-16 12:35:14	rnelson0	well it works fine in p3
2015-11-16 12:36:07	rnelson0	but "hiera_hash() has been converted to 4x API" leads me to believe that with puppet 4 there's a different function to call entirely. I just don't know what it is.
2015-11-16 12:37:41	Speedr	based off functions/hiera_hash.rb it doesn't look that way, looks like call_function should call that which calls hiera/puppet_function which then runs whatever init_dispatch is needed and uses the merge override on the private method
2015-11-16 12:38:09	Speedr	hard for me to test, I haven't spun up any 4.x

2015-11-16 12:45:05	rnelson0	Speedr: then why is call_function falling to the Puppet::Parser::Functions hiera_hash instead of the Puppet::Functions hiera_hash?
2015-11-16 12:45:16	Speedr	that's what i'm wondering
2015-11-16 12:45:37	Speedr	that's why I mentioned that second link where they discussed fixing the old calls, maybe it's calling the old ones first rather than the new?

2016-01-14 12:57:44	MichaelSmith	There should be a YAMLCPP_LIBRARY variable defined in CMakeCache.txt if it was found, and there isn't. But there should've been an error from cmake when it wasn't found.
2016-01-14 12:59:06	msg31	MichaelSmith, I've built gcc, boost, yaml-cpp, and cmake and installed in /opt/pl-build-tools. My goal is to build puppet-agent

2016-01-14 13:01:25	MichaelSmith	YAMLCPP_STATIC forces looking for libyaml-cpp.a, otherwise it falls back to searching for yaml-cpp (which will prefer a shared library, but will use the static as a fallback).
2016-01-14 13:02:26	MichaelSmith	I'm looking into how CMake might get into that state.

2016-01-14 13:46:07	MichaelSmith	YAMLCPP_LIBRARY is expected to point to the actual library file; it's also set automatically if CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH points to the root where you expect it to be installed (/opt/pl-build-tools).

2016-01-14 13:51:36	MichaelSmith	The puppet-agent project could use some tweaks so it's simple to build with off-the-shelf packages. The toolchain file pretty much just says where to get the right compiler (in case it's not the default on PATH, we need GCC 4.8+) and where to find package dependencies.
2016-01-14 13:52:44	msg31	I'm hoping to provide some patches for ppc64-le
2016-01-14 13:52:53	msg31	but first I got to get things to build on x86_64 :p
2016-01-14 13:53:09	MichaelSmith	Ah, awesome.
2016-01-14 13:53:37	msg31	MichaelSmith, are you familiar with the puppet-agent build process? Does it fetch the latest puppet components from git? Is it using the latest stable?
2016-01-14 13:54:30	+stahnma	msg31: it can do either
2016-01-14 13:55:01	+stahnma	we usually just build from git until close to a release
2016-01-14 13:55:06	+stahnma	then pick a specific tag
2016-01-14 13:55:06	msg31	stahnma, how do you specify what it should do? This is what I'm currently running.
2016-01-14 13:55:07	msg31	../ruby/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/bin/bundle exec ../ruby/bin/ruby ../ruby/bin/build puppet-agent el-7-x86_64 192.168.122.175
2016-01-14 13:55:10	MichaelSmith	It decides what branch or SHA to pull from git based on config/components/*.json files
2016-01-14 13:55:26	+stahnma	msg31: yeah, we just edit those json files.
2016-01-14 13:55:44	msg31	cool, that is easy
2016-01-14 13:56:14	MichaelSmith	If we're not pulling from git, it usually gets hard-coded into the component file, like in ruby.rb. You'll see `pkg.version 2.1.8` and `pkg.url ...`
2016-01-14 13:56:31	MichaelSmith	I suspect you had to change all the .url links already.
2016-01-14 13:57:10	msg31	Yep, manually fetched 21 source packages and updated the urls to point internally
2016-01-14 13:57:37	MichaelSmith	For puppet, the line `pkg.load_from_json("configs/components/puppet.json")` loads a file pointing to a git url and ref.
2016-01-14 13:58:18	msg31	I see that, easy to change / update
2016-01-14 13:58:55	msg31	It sounds like I should build yaml-cpp dynamically?

2016-01-14 14:02:23	+stahnma	msg31: I'd think so
2016-01-14 14:02:41	MichaelSmith	Yeah. Strange that it's not built with fPIC.
2016-01-14 14:02:54	+stahnma	msg31: Sorry this is such a pain. I'm very interested in all of your experiences when this is complete.
2016-01-14 14:03:39	+stahnma	MichaelSmith: We may have an ifarch on ppc in there to disable PPC? I'd think we pivot on AIX OS, but I could be wrong. Just a thought

2016-01-14 14:10:40	MichaelSmith	If YAMLCPP_STATIC is still set in your CMakeCache.txt, you need to get rid of that.

2016-01-14 14:11:22	MichaelSmith	I've been a proponent of putting that in the toolchain file, haven't won yet :)
2016-01-14 14:11:45	msg31	I removed CMakeCache.txt
2016-01-14 14:12:25	MichaelSmith	The component config may still be setting it when invoking CMake. That would end up with it in the project Makefile.
2016-01-14 14:13:07	msg31	I added `SET(YAMLCPP_LIBRARY /opt/pl-build-tools/lib/libyaml-cpp.so)` to /opt/pl-build-tools/pl-build-toolchain.cmake which allowed make facter-configure to complete successfully, but that seems wrong
2016-01-14 14:13:36	msg31	With that said, I just successfully built facter without any error!
2016-01-14 14:14:31	+stahnma	msg31: then you're mostly through the hard parts :)
2016-01-14 14:14:49	msg31	except libfactor.so.3.2.0 links against libyaml-cpp.so.5
2016-01-14 14:15:15	msg31	does that get statically merged later in the build process?
2016-01-14 14:15:21	+stahnma	MichaelSmith: why haven't we done that?
2016-01-14 14:15:52	MichaelSmith	stahnma: I don't remember the reason. I think it makes sense for Boost and yaml-cpp.
2016-01-14 14:16:01	+stahnma	fair
2016-01-14 14:16:23	MichaelSmith	msg31: it doesn't get merged. If you're linking dynamically, you'll want to add a step to config/component/runtime.rb to copy it into the package.
2016-01-14 14:16:52	MichaelSmith	stahnma: ^ also that's a reason why it's not so simple
2016-01-14 14:17:19	msg31	So maybe I build yaml-cpp statically with -fPIC, I can avoid that?
2016-01-14 14:17:30	msg31	I'm pretty green when it comes to compiling and linking software
2016-01-14 14:19:15	MichaelSmith	There are other cases where we use dynamic linking and copy the shared library into the package. It's not that unusual. But yes, -fPIC when compiling yaml-cpp would probably solve the link issue you saw before.
2016-01-14 14:21:19	msg31	MichaelSmith, stahnma, thanks so much for the help. I'm sure I'll be bugging you again

2016-01-15 14:01:55	+stahnma	you should be able to adjust that
2016-01-15 14:02:16	+stahnma	basically you need to have a plat.provision_with "rm -rf /opt/puppetlabs /etc/puppetlabs/ /var/log/puppetlabs /var/tmp/tmp.*"

I reran that same code on AMQ 5.10.0 through 5.13.0 (we currently ship with 5.12.0) and found the logs get correctly cleaned up in 5.10.0. More recent versions it is not as reliable, My example should cleanup 3 files, it only cleans up 1 on recent versions, all 3 on 5.10.0.
