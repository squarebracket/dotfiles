2016-01-13 10:21:07	keekz	it's if you use     AuthGroupFile /opt/graphite/sec/.mygroups
2016-01-13 10:21:13	keekz	and     Require group managers
2016-01-13 10:21:38	keekz	you don't need to require a group specifically, you can require a valid user (and not require a group)
2016-01-13 10:23:13	keekz	this shows just the user bits: http://www.webreference.com/programming/apache_authentication/index.html

I found a few documents, but were a bit old.  Reading through the docs, I'm not finding too much unfortunately.  Anyone have an idea where I can find a document on getting the hostname sent to Graphite?
