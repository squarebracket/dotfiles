2015-11-25 16:11:19	squarebracket	Does the system type create a systemd file? I've got a call to create a gunicorn service, but it fails saying that the gunicorn service doesn't exist
2015-11-25 16:11:25	squarebracket	err, service type
2015-11-25 16:12:15	torrancew	no, it manages the state of a service, and is dependent on that service already existing
2015-11-25 16:12:27	squarebracket	Ok, so I have to inject my own service definition into systemd?
2015-11-25 16:12:37	torrancew	you could create it with a file { } and then manage it, etc
2015-11-25 16:12:45	torrancew	yep

If you need the top-scope variable when you've overridden it in localscope then you have to faff around a bit and I'd recommend making a local-scope variable which is simply set to the top-scope variable  $my_top_enc_variable = $::enc_variable

2015-11-26 21:10:45	ℹ 	Monthrect is now known as Piper-Off
2015-11-26 21:10:58	agaffney	you'd probably be better off writing a custom parser function to do the whole thing

2015-11-26 21:11:01	ninjapold	It seems to be passing the arguments properly but the generate function is adding backslashes which breaks it!!
2015-11-26 21:11:17	agaffney	the generate() function is...special
2015-11-26 21:11:21	ninjapold	Yeah that's what I though too but I don't know how to and I'm not sure I have the time to spend
2015-11-26 21:11:26	ninjapold	Yeah it seems to behave strange
2015-11-26 21:11:33	ninjapold	and the documentation is very vague
2015-11-26 21:11:41	agaffney	parser functions are pretty easy, assuming you know any ruby
2015-11-26 21:11:49	agaffney	even if you don't, it's not hard to take a few examples and hack something together

2015-11-26 21:13:40	agaffney	well, ruby makes it a bit easier to run an external command. ideally, you'd do all your timezone logic in this function, but it's "good enough" to just have it do what you're trying to do with generate()
2015-11-26 21:14:09	agaffney	find an example custom parser function, and replace most of the body with %x{/bin/date -d 'TZ="US/Arizona" 01:00' +%-H}
2015-11-26 21:14:30	agaffney	%x{} is the ruby way to run an external command and capture the output

2015-11-26 21:20:35	agaffney	try just replacing the middle 3 lines in that example with the one I gave you, and then rename the function (and make sure the name of the .rb file with your function matches the function name)
2015-11-26 21:20:48	ninjapold	yeah doing that now
2015-11-26 21:21:33	agaffney	if you feel brave later, add some parsing and the date calc stuff (or whatever you need to do) directly to that parser function
2015-11-26 21:22:20	ninjapold	yeah I'd like to use the ruby date functions rather than outsourcing it to 'Date'
2015-11-26 21:22:38	ninjapold	Can I pass variables in to the external command?
2015-11-26 21:23:40	agaffney	ruby does variable interpolation in strings with #{varname}, but I'm unsure if that can be used directly inside of %x{...}
2015-11-26 21:23:55	ninjapold	Okay, I'll try it
2015-11-26 21:24:07	agaffney	but easy enough to break the command out into a separate var and then use that var to run the command

2015-11-26 23:39:10	seanscottking	hey everybody. i see that the stealthymonkey yum repo's mod_passenger is having a problem. it's even documented in puppetlabs/apache's README.md as a known issue. basically "yum install mod_passenger" will fail because the RPM is built to require a version of ruby that does not exist in RHEL repos. does anyone have a workaround for it?
2015-11-26 23:39:55	seanscottking	obviously this isn't #passenger chan but puppet community relies on passenger so i asked here first
2015-11-26 23:40:15	seanscottking	seems like a major problem for them. wonder why it isn't fixed yet

2015-11-27 00:40:55	jrhett	seanscottking: what's the use case you are trying to solve for? and which version of CentOS/RHEL and ruby?
2015-11-27 00:41:51	jrhett	for CentOS 7 it's simply "curl -sSLo passenger.repo \ https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/yum/definitions/el-passenger.repo"
2015-11-27 00:41:58	seanscottking	centos 6.5

2015-11-27 00:42:29	seanscottking	it's quite a simple problem actually.  centos 6.5 ships with ruby 1.8.7.374.  but mod_passenger (via stealthmonkeys repo) wants like .352 or something
2015-11-27 00:42:51	jrhett	stealthmonkeys is gone, no updates for years
2015-11-27 00:42:55	jrhett	use that repo ^^^
2015-11-27 00:43:24	seanscottking	you don't say
2015-11-27 00:43:56	jrhett	carots meaning the phusion repo which does have working binaries

This is impossible because puppet executes as root. and it wont allow access to the shares. Are there any possibilities to define as what user puppet should mount or browse a directory?

2015-11-27 13:42:12	Helio-	hell, the only way to tell which version of the vmware hypervisor you are running on, to determine the appropriate tools, is to look at the BIOS memory offset via dmidecode
2015-11-27 13:42:41	Helio-	seanscottking: you might be able to modify it
2015-11-27 13:42:50	seanscottking	https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/2.2/core_facts.html#virtual "On Darwin, use the macosx util module to acquire the SPHardwareDataType and SPEthernetDataType, from which it is possible to determine if the host is a VMware, Parallels, or VirtualBox. This previously used SPDisplaysDataType, which was not reliable if running headless, and also caused lagging issues on actual Macs."
2015-11-27 13:43:56	ruchlos	one can probably do something like was done for vmware process check for virtualbox

2015-11-27 13:49:04	seanscottking	you know what, i think i am going to go down a different road with this. it's not fair to set the logic on $virtual to determine if this is a vagrant box or not.  vagrant can use many providers besides VirtualBox

Is this still right information, or can I just install newest puppet agent on Mac OSX (and of course the newest puppetmaster on *nix)?

2015-12-07 15:03:21	agaffney	iirc, the Exec created by the 'apt' module only gets defined if you actually include the 'apt' class, and then it always gets run
2015-12-07 15:03:39	agaffney	you typically put a blurb in site.pp to order it before any Package resources

2015-12-07 15:08:14	foul_owl	So, when I try to add a repo, apt-get update is supposed to run, as configs have changed

Since I have the separate defined types being created by different create_resources() calls I thought that perhaps it's somehow not seeing the calls for creating bind::a when it's doing bind::zone.  The reason why is because it complains that the call to bind::a I make "doesn't exist in the catalog" when it's trying to build the

2015-12-11 13:25:57	theCzar	I'm using old-style iteration in a puppet module, creating a defined type to iterate over an array of hashes.  I'm trying to write a test for this define in rspec-puppet, attempting to assign a hash to the :title using let().  The title is then supposed to be set to my variable called $daemon, yet my tests keep throwing errors saying that $daemon is not a hash or array.
2015-12-11 13:26:31	theCzar	I'm actually abit new to using defined types for iteration, and very new at rspec-puppet, so I'm not sure if I'm missing something obvious here or not.

2015-12-11 17:51:32	Seventoes	haha
2015-12-11 17:52:09	agaffney	I always did the SSL cert portion of provisioning a new master by hand
2015-12-11 17:52:48	agaffney	puppet agent would build everything out, and then I'd run 'puppet cert generate ...' on the CA server, manually copy the cert/key, and kick nginx(/unicorn)
2015-12-11 17:52:58	agaffney	but I wasn't auto-scaling
2015-12-11 17:53:27	timdau	I've inherited a rather complex puppet install.  I am confused where "info: Applying configuration version" is coming from.  It should be coming from config_version in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf on the master... but it isn't.

Whenever I put data in the %{clientcert}.yaml file, it always overrides the global.yaml.  I have :deep_merge_behavior: deep set.  Is there any way to do a debug of the hiera lookups from the client TO the puppet server?

I've just tried this with puppet apply (4.3.1) and it's not complaining about the group being an integer.. am I missing something or that change is not necessary?

2015-12-15 03:54:49	ruchlos	hmm.. contain doesn't do ordering, just makes sure ordering against the container includes the contained classes

2015-12-15 03:56:49	ptierno	ruchlos: im a big fan of relationships via metaparameters. and internally to a class that can replace the need for anchors
2015-12-15 03:57:03	karimb	ruchlos so i sthouls still use anchors
2015-12-15 03:57:12	ptierno	but it has been a while since i have written a module that wasn't readily available on the forge
2015-12-15 03:57:30	ruchlos	karimb: no, use contain for anchors and relationship for ordering
2015-12-15 03:57:42	ruchlos	anchors are for old versions and not core anyway
2015-12-15 03:57:47	Volcane	kjetilho: how does contain not replace anchors? neither are for ordering they are for containment, but they enable ordering
2015-12-15 03:59:01	Volcane	anchors ordered due to that basically being a side effect and the only way it could achieve containment, but the problem they solve was containment.  and the contain function replaces that

2015-12-15 06:30:44	lhopki01	When I do a puppet run with puppet agent -t it hangs on loading facts
2015-12-15 06:31:33	lhopki01	The only thing I can find online is a ticket from 4 years ago that seems to be related to kernel versions but I'm not on any of those kernel versions.

2015-12-15 08:24:43	bazrush___	Then I think the module is poorly designed for these situations?  I'll work around it anyway - fixing the module is WAY away from actually getting this job done :
2015-12-15 08:25:10	nzst	Is there a command I can run against a puppet agent or it's environment to ascertain if a handshake was successful with a puppet master?
2015-12-15 08:25:26	Volcane	bazrush___: perhaps, machines without ssh though is pretty unusual, how do you even get that?

2015-12-15 11:56:54	jlambert	so forge module names are case sensitive and you aren't allowed to sign up with different usernames (different case) and can't change your username.  i also can't figure out how to delete an account on the forge.  can someone help me a) delete a forge account, b) change the username on a forge account (just lower case what I used), or c) help me with an option c :)

2015-12-15 17:41:40	BarnacleBob	you can probably get away with moving software-properties-common to its own define and not relying on update.  since apt will have it in the default list of packages

2015-12-16 09:17:37	raphink	yo61, if you call "puppetserver ruby" every time you start r10k, it's going to be very slow
2015-12-16 09:17:59	raphink	not that puppetserver is slow per se, but the JVM overhead is quite huge
2015-12-16 09:18:20	@Volcane	the difference is one is a cli tool and one is a tool to be hosted inside the ruby VM used by the master
2015-12-16 09:18:34	raphink	jaxim, no, hiera is run from within Puppet, and hiera-eyaml from within hiera. So hiera-eyaml must be installed using "puppetserver gem" (see our puppetserver module for example)

2015-12-16 11:23:28	Laaw	hey we had a tiny little typo in one of our modules where a single colon was there instaed of a double colon -- puppet should pick up that change, now that we've fixed it, yes?
2015-12-16 11:24:01	jtreminio	Hi all! Using puppet 4.3.1 using the all in one installer; I know it has its own ruby and gem packaged at `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/`. However, it seems if I install RVM in the system that the `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem` defaults to using RVM's ruby. Is there a way around this?

2015-12-24 12:27:32	tokynet	so, we use a fact to set the puppet env

2015-12-24 12:42:13	agaffney	I haven't read the scrollback, so I don't know what type of custom fact it is

2015-12-24 12:52:20	@Volcane	what you're trying to achieve is obvious, we get what the goal is
2015-12-24 12:52:23	Ro2xB	an EC2 is launched. A script runs on boot which installs puppet agent and sets up conf to have an environment = custom line
2015-12-24 12:52:24	@Volcane	no further explanation needed
2015-12-24 12:52:33	@Volcane	HOW you're doing it is obviously flawed as its not working

2015-12-24 12:53:08	@Volcane	you're telling us you are running 2 commands.  thats trivial to gist
2015-12-24 12:53:28	Ro2xB	we expect our ENC to pick up that setting from the ec2's conf, if present, and use it
2015-12-24 12:53:34	Ro2xB	that's all I wanted to get out there
2015-12-24 12:53:51	agaffney	if the ENC provides an environment, the value from the agent is ignored
2015-12-24 12:54:00	agaffney	ENC trumps agent
2015-12-24 12:54:01	Ro2xB	what we are seeing is that, although the conf file is set and custom fact present
2015-12-24 12:54:11	@Volcane	yeah ENC wins
2015-12-24 12:54:16	Ro2xB	the ENC is not applying correctly
2015-12-24 12:54:25	Ro2xB	ok.
2015-12-24 12:54:33	Ro2xB	but the logic on the enc is
2015-12-24 12:54:49	agaffney	if you want to be able to override the puppet environment from the agent, the ENC cannot specify one at all
2015-12-24 12:54:49	Ro2xB	if custom fact for env is present, use env specified on instance conf
2015-12-24 12:54:55	Ro2xB	else use vpc-specific env
2015-12-24 12:55:02	agaffney	how does the ENC have access to the custom facts?
2015-12-24 12:55:08	agaffney	iirc, it only gets a hostname on the commandline

2015-12-24 12:58:46	@Volcane	facts would get written to master disk, used to be they get written before calling the ENC, think that might have changed recently
2015-12-24 12:59:05	@Volcane	so ENCs could in the past do the trick where they read the facts yaml and it would be current facts
2015-12-24 12:59:13	@Volcane	but thats not really the case anymore iirc
2015-12-24 12:59:15	agaffney	reading on https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html, the ENC only has *direct* access to the hostname passed on the commandline
2015-12-24 12:59:31	agaffney	if you want to access facts, you must do something yourself in the ENC to read them from somewhere

2015-12-24 12:59:53	@Volcane	agaffney: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html#tricks-notes-and-further-reading but i doubt thats current or useful
2015-12-24 13:00:09	tokynet	the odd part is that this works on the 2nd run
2015-12-24 13:00:25	tokynet	which is why i've been asking if we can see the "payload" from the agent to the master
2015-12-24 13:00:30	Ro2xB	right. so the initial agent run uses the "default" environment, but subsequent runs honor the setting from the conf file
2015-12-24 13:00:48	@Volcane	Ro2xB: depends i guess how your ENC gets the facts - since as we say there isnt a std way
2015-12-24 13:01:08	agaffney	can you pastebin/gist the code of the ENC? it sounds like you're reading the facts from somewhere, but they aren't updated until after the first run
2015-12-24 13:01:22	Ro2xB	the ENC is the puppet console
2015-12-24 13:01:25	tokynet	we do not do anything special to give the ENC access to the facts

2015-12-24 13:01:49	agaffney	"the puppet console"? are you talking about PE?
2015-12-24 13:02:00	Ro2xB	yes
2015-12-24 13:02:06	tokynet	we just create custom facts on 1 module (basic_server) and let plugin sync handle the rest
2015-12-24 13:02:18	tokynet	yes, i've been saying PE all along ;)
2015-12-24 13:02:33	⚡	agaffney knows nothing about how the PE ENC works, as he doesn't use PE
2015-12-24 13:02:45	@Volcane	then if you're editing puppet.conf via facts it will only work on the 2nd run
2015-12-24 13:02:51	tokynet	thats the thing, we used to not use it all...

2015-12-24 13:03:54	agaffney	the point is that the updated facts from the agent are not available until *after* the first puppet run against the master
2015-12-24 13:04:06	agaffney	so the first run against the master will NOT have the updated facts, as you've already seen

2015-12-24 13:06:29	@Volcane	agaffney: suspect PE is a bit different their node group things are fact based and can set environment based on various rules and shit
2015-12-24 13:06:33	Ro2xB	but perhaps that's not the case ... that's what we're trying to track down about PE's process for updating facts
2015-12-24 13:06:51	@Volcane	but then in the PE console for this node after the first run you should be able to see all its factss iirc so you can se what the value is after first run
2015-12-24 13:07:16	tokynet	yes, initially we thought the problem was that we were waiting on that initial pluginsync to bring the custom-facts.rb script so the agent would have it available, so we bundled that script into the Instance and we populate it right after the agent has been installed. Then we start the agent and expected the agent to send the custom-fact to the master in its
2015-12-24 13:07:16	tokynet	payload (which is what we are trying to verify)
2015-12-24 13:07:21	@Volcane	so run your first failing run, check PE console to see what facts are

2015-12-24 13:43:02	@Volcane	there's a PE node group you cna put the new nodes in i think that lets the node puppet.conf win wrt environment

2015-12-24 13:45:10	tokynet	Volcane: on the first report i see on the PE console, the fact is there. what you are saying is eventhough the agent sent it in its initial "payload" the Console did not know what to do with it?

2015-12-24 18:48:01	fraq	so this is a little different. It looks like the setup for that is to have beaker use an existing puppetdb. I still think that beaker can help you more than a homebrewed vagrant config, though.

2016-01-06 14:50:18	whitenoise_	so basically the logstash profile I want to spin up, grab the configs from S3, but it has discovery of kafka instances that it stores in facts on the box...and so I need it to be a template so it can be dynamic in that regard.
2016-01-06 14:50:31	whitenoise_	since currently we do not have sophisticated service discovery. that's on the list for after the new environment is up.
2016-01-06 14:50:42	@binford2k	YamakasY: it means that Puppet doesn't think it needs to do anything. Either it's already done, or you're not including the classification you think you are.

2016-01-06 14:52:27	whitenoise_	I could do that. I did consider doing that. Since our organization has the puppet repo locked down, that would make it to where only 3 people could upload new templates, whereas the other way more people (i.e., developers) would have access.

2016-01-06 14:55:02	whitenoise_	binford2k: true, that might be something we can look at. ultimately this is part of the reason I wanted to take us masterless, because we also have various segregated environments, which can't talk to one another over the network for security purposes, and having to deploy masters everywhere is tiresome, but generally there is some box in each environment
2016-01-06 14:55:02	whitenoise_	with internet access. doing that might help us segregate automation out into more "open" and "closed" modules, though.
2016-01-06 14:55:03	Seventoes	i'd expect that pointing an agent at a new CA server would fail due to the new CA cert, and the new CA not having the old client cert anyways

2016-01-06 14:56:58	whitenoise_	across masters and have them be HA, so you can easily end up with 6 for roughly the same environment.
2016-01-06 14:57:06	whitenoise_	so you have any advice there as far as masterless vs some other way of doing it?

2016-01-06 16:05:22	acidrainfall	I would greatly appreciate a tip on the best direction to head with what I need to do here.  Bear with me, it's hard to explain...  The elasticsearch module from elastic doesn't offer me the option of including gc_log_file (garbage collection logging)... but the problem is, if I define it, I also must *export* it in the init file.
2016-01-06 16:05:34	acidrainfall	But a location for the file is also necessary.
2016-01-06 16:05:42	@binford2k	Seventoes: yes, if the ca.pem doesn't exist, the agent will download it first
2016-01-06 16:06:01	acidrainfall	My preference would simply be to 'if gc_log_file' then add from both .erb files

2016-01-07 14:04:42	tgm4883	Using 3.8.0, trying to have a setting differ (noop=true vs noop=false) on two mutually exclusive lists of servers. Trying to figure the best way to do this. I think somehow having a default for all servers, then having a group with the alternate setting would be best, but how to accomplish that in puppet code?

2016-01-07 15:29:41	@binford2k	KG4ZOW: r10k does not. The puppet master knows when its environment cache expires and it reloads. Or you force a refresh

2016-01-07 15:30:32	ruchlos	foul_owl: does that setup work? since to use site for modules, you'd need to extend your modulepath (either in puppet.conf or, as I and control-repo do) in environment.conf

2016-01-07 15:34:09	@binford2k	jorhett: it lets you make small modules that don't really need a separate repo within the control-repo and still manage external modules via Puppetfile
2016-01-07 15:34:13	ruchlos	so I moved them under site and everything is now happy (and also .gitignore the modules so my dev environment is happy too)
2016-01-07 15:34:23	jorhett	FriedBob: never count on cache expiration. The server threads (or master processes) died off and restart at different times, so you can get inconsistent answers during the same Puppet run
2016-01-07 15:34:34	ruchlos	I also could have made Puppetfile deploy to shared modules dir and not have environment modules

2016-01-07 15:40:24	jorhett	You end up with dependencies that cross both repos, and then even r10k can't manage it effectively

2016-01-07 15:42:36	jorhett	as always, DWWFY but when it starts to be a pain I recommend pulling back to the simple model rather than fighting it

2016-01-08 12:15:49	Shubby	I'm trying to use the official mysql module to configure a MySQL Server 5.7.10 instance, Puppet (3.4.3) is throwing this error: Error: mysql_install_db --basedir=/usr --defaults-extra-file=/etc/my.cnf --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --user=mysql returned 1 instead of one of [0] -- so everything that depends on that errors out as well
2016-01-08 12:15:57	Shubby	I know the error is because Puppet is not passing --defaults-extra-file= as the first argument (you must), so I fished around the module’s code and found this: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/mysql_datadir/mysql.rb#L36-L47 — which shows the module is set to handle the correct syntax for a MySQL 5.7 install
2016-01-08 12:16:09	Shubby	Then I looked up what’s supposed to return mysqld_version and found this custom fact: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/blob/master/lib/facter/mysql_version.rb — so now I’m wondering whether the fact is returning my version of MySQL correctly, since the module is behaving as if mysql_version was either nil or something other than 5.7.x
2016-01-08 12:16:20	Shubby	but I'm not sure where to go from here

2016-01-10 12:26:47	mishanti1	Hi all. Im having some issues getting puppet master to start when running through apache+passenger. Passenger starts, but I ser no Rack puppetmaster process.
2016-01-10 12:27:34	mishanti1	No matter what I have tried I have not been able to get any errors to show. Any idea how I might go about debugging?
2016-01-10 12:28:00	mishanti1	This is running on debian jessie with puppet 3.7 from apt.

2016-01-10 12:37:26	agaffney	if passenger is enabled in general in a separate .conf file than your vhost, then your vhost conf file may not be readable to apache in some way
2016-01-10 12:37:28	mishanti1	agaffney: It does not. Checked with netstat and direct connection.
2016-01-10 12:37:58	mishanti1	So it might be a permission problem?

2016-01-10 12:38:17	agaffney	that, or maybe it's name doesn't end in .conf
2016-01-10 12:38:40	agaffney	most stock apache configs will only include files ending with .conf in the conf.d dirs
2016-01-10 12:38:56	agaffney	if the vhost config was *wrong*, apache would probably tell you quite loudly
2016-01-10 12:39:21	mishanti1	Yeah, apache likes to nitpick. :)
2016-01-10 12:39:39	mishanti1	Thanks for the tips. I'll see what I find.

2016-01-11 12:24:29	elricsfate	Gotcha. That makes sense. So establish connectivity between the on prem master OR the off prem and a git/filestore. Wouldn't the on prem master try and contact servers in off prem and vice versa?
2016-01-11 12:24:47	agaffney	contact for what?
2016-01-11 12:24:47	ruchlos	but if you "create two Puppet Masters" with the help of Puppet then they don't need to be related at all. unless there's something you want them to share?

2016-01-11 12:25:52	elricsfate	agaffney, Probably not. I'm more so trying to provide a central location to manage both on prem and off servers.
2016-01-11 12:26:06	jeffreylevesque_	i have command => "systemctl enable ${compiler}",
2016-01-11 12:26:24	ruchlos	jeffreylevesque_: no, don't use execs,they are last resort. look into service resource

2016-01-11 12:26:46	jeffreylevesque_	i'm using centos 7.2
2016-01-11 12:26:47	elricsfate	That way someone who has servers on on prem and off prem can have a single repo (or a single location) to work on their systems

2016-01-11 12:27:06	agaffney	elricsfate: what exactly does it mean to manage off- and on-prem agents in the same location? just be able to push a puppet manifest or node definition change and have it affect both sets of servers?
2016-01-11 12:27:25	ruchlos	jeffreylevesque_: might have to tell it provider=systemd but it should pick that up anyway

2016-01-11 12:31:29	ruchlos	it's a deb thing it seems
2016-01-11 12:31:33	acidrainfall	that's what I think
2016-01-11 12:31:36	acidrainfall	it's all debian

2016-01-11 12:32:15	acidrainfall	it is alternatives
2016-01-11 12:32:16	@eric0	when i do 'alternatives --display java' it says " link currently points to /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java"
2016-01-11 12:32:24	acidrainfall	which it should
2016-01-11 12:32:29	acidrainfall	but that's the path
2016-01-11 12:32:31	@eric0	so i think that's the value it'd expect
2016-01-11 12:32:31	acidrainfall	not the "name"
2016-01-11 12:32:37	acidrainfall	it has an alternative_path as well
2016-01-11 12:32:47	acidrainfall	it would be redundant to specify both?  I think maybe it's a debian thing

2016-01-11 13:19:44	acidrainfall	It's partially a docs problem, the docs aren't specific in saying that those parameters only work for debian-based machines.  The other problem is that it's just as easy to do on redhat but nobody has.  I think I will.

2016-01-11 13:24:05	acidrainfall	there's a commit that says they added the package for debian, but I don't even see where they did that

2016-01-11 17:40:46	greeneg	Hi *. I've got a question for those that manage OS X workstations/notebooks with Puppet. Currently, we have an OS X server running OD in magic triangle to push MCX stuff to clients. Since Workgroup Manager is essentially dead, and Apple wants people to move to the Managed Profile setup, how are you working with this in a Puppetized infra?

The problem is that in a single puppet run config file is not properly configured. Right after 2nd run the file is in place. Anyone have an advice how to fix?

2016-01-13 08:41:15	Sage905	So.. Old system was: One control repo, with a Puppetfile, and role/profile modules in a site subdir
2016-01-13 08:41:31	Sage905	And I would run librarian-puppet on the client

2016-01-13 08:45:20	@Volcane	that goes in environment.conf so you can set it now per environment thats better

2016-01-13 08:45:54	@Volcane	really its not that difficult, you're just changing from one directory to another and adding a 1 or 2 line file to each environment

2016-01-13 08:46:44	Sage905	In my case, environments are overkill.
2016-01-13 08:46:58	@Volcane	you've basically said that you dont like puppet concept of environment - because you've your own where you check out an environment x over a directory y
2016-01-13 08:47:02	@Volcane	and this doesnt work

2016-01-13 08:47:21	@Volcane	not surprisingly because thats not how anyone else does it, puppet is designed to be used in a way and the design permuates out
2016-01-13 08:47:22	Sage905	No.. I just don't need multiple environments.
2016-01-13 08:47:34	@Volcane	deviate from it and it gets ever more annoying as you're inventoring your own wheel
2016-01-13 08:47:44	Sage905	If I were running with a master, I'd need two, prod and dev.
2016-01-13 08:48:05	@Volcane	and your node would set which one it belongs to....just like with apply
2016-01-13 08:48:09	Sage905	I understand what you are saying, but also keep in mind that I'm trying to use concepts I've learned from others' experience.

2016-01-13 08:48:53	Sage905	Ok, well, that's good news. :)
2016-01-13 08:48:59	@Volcane	you're exactly doing that, you have environments, you're just trying to not make puppet aware of them
2016-01-13 08:49:24	Sage905	So as far as workflow goes, may I ask how you manage dependant modules?
2016-01-13 08:49:40	Sage905	I'm thinking of just running librarian-puppet on my dev machine, and committing everything to my git repo.
2016-01-13 08:49:51	@Volcane	i have a 'forge' dir where i use librarian to put them there, though i dont run that on every machine
2016-01-13 08:49:58	@Volcane	i commit the built result into git

2016-01-13 08:50:34	@Volcane	if it works once - where i build my git repo - i know it'll work everywhere and not end up in some case where half way through a rollout the forge has a hiccup or whatever
2016-01-13 08:50:40	Sage905	Also, it gives you known-good versions, and removes dependency on the forge during deploy.
2016-01-13 08:50:50	@Volcane	effectively i dont depend on the forge post dev stage on my shell
2016-01-13 08:51:06	Sage905	Cool... Good to hear my thinking was on the right path for a change. :)
2016-01-13 08:51:38	@Volcane	running librarian on every machine is looking for trouble esp as it does dependency resolution

2016-01-13 08:54:32	@Volcane	its one machine but its not like its a island
2016-01-13 08:54:45	Sage905	So... You don't have a separate git branch for dev?
2016-01-13 08:54:46	@Volcane	you want to use environment data, or different modules etc
2016-01-13 08:55:03	Sage905	Do you copy files from environments/dev to environments/production?
2016-01-13 08:55:24	@Volcane	and all machines - not ideal but works for me - gets all the code for all the environments, you'd figure out what would work for you to avoid that, for me i dont care

2016-01-13 09:55:45	rob_	hmm

2016-01-13 09:57:31	rob_	class { 'apt': ... } is the first thing in profile::base which gets included into all our roles, we're using 4.x
2016-01-13 09:57:39	rob_	i thought some kind of ordering had been introduced
2016-01-13 09:58:47	@Volcane	in this case its the order in which puppet reads the .pp files
2016-01-13 09:59:01	@Volcane	first time it scans through them whoever comes first wins
2016-01-13 09:59:16	@Volcane	using class{"apt": ...} style is just generally a mistake

2016-01-13 15:58:17	gord0	with something like <%= @cluster_name %> there is a chance of conflict with a global var. Can I do something only lookup local vars other than doing something that makes it really long like this <%= scope.lookupvar('testclass::cluster_name') %>
2016-01-13 15:58:18	darkling	Assuming that I've got randomly-assigned IP addresses, say.

2016-01-13 15:59:12	darkling	I think I get that part -- you can write arbitrary code to return node-specific information. But where does that information come from?
2016-01-13 15:59:15	Sage905	Ah... I see... In your role, you specify classes: '::role:blah'

2016-01-13 15:59:40	Epx998	Can I generate a puppetmaster cert without the ALT dns names, running the master daemon to generate my certs always creates alt-dns entries that do not exist.
2016-01-13 16:00:00	darkling	Would I just look it up in the contents of /etc/role, and then create /etc/role with "webserver" in it immediately after I start up the node, before running puppet on it?

2016-01-13 16:02:08	darkling	OK, so an ENC would have some kind of datastore lookup, and when I deploy a node, I add the node's unique ID (primary external IP address, or whatever) to the datastore, and put the node's role in that?

2016-01-13 16:43:03	jorhett	devicenull: depends on how you do cert management. If you use an NFS share then any Puppet server works fine. The newer and better approach is to have the cert service running on a single server, with all masters using that.
2016-01-13 16:43:04	devicenull	very mysterious as to what's actually supported

2016-01-13 16:43:23	devicenull	yea that's what I have now, a seperate ca_server that handles certs
2016-01-13 16:43:33	devicenull	I was not clear if that's the best approach or not

2016-01-13 16:44:03	jorhett	the new/best? way is to run the CA service on a single node, and specify the CA server in puppet.conf on everything: nodes, servers, api clients, etc.
2016-01-13 16:44:41	jorhett	appears to work fine to load balance across two nodes with NFS shared ssldir

2016-01-14 10:20:49	+WhatsARanjit	oddjob: I ran across this example- in Linux when you grep, if there are no matches, that is exitcode 1.
2016-01-14 10:21:15	+WhatsARanjit	oddjob: In Windows, if you do a Find with no matches, it returns exitcode 0 because the Find was executed successfully.

2016-01-14 10:21:45	oddjob	hmmm.  i dont have that issue.  but that might be because findstr and find are both quirky.  i use findstr almost everywhere.  find seems to cause issues like you said
2016-01-14 10:22:16	+WhatsARanjit	oddjob: So in most cases, your actual powershell command should specify the return code. https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-iis/blob/master/manifests/manage_site.pp#L34
2016-01-14 10:24:38	oddjob	WhatsARanjit: yes, which can be a real pain when using a single simple one line unless or onlyif check - and thank you for pointing me to that.  i was just going there next.  so youre right.  looks like True/False do not work for ps returns

2016-01-14 18:47:45	darkling	What's the best way of preserving/maintaining a puppet configuration? Say I've got a load of third-party modules installed (from public git), some local modules (also in git -- but one per git repo? all in one git repo?), and some manifests (separate git repo for those?).
2016-01-14 18:48:08	darkling	Do I just rely on a normal file-level backup?
2016-01-14 18:48:19	TechIsCool	git and r10k?
2016-01-14 18:48:31	darkling	Or is there a recommended approach for rebuilding that kind of setup from all the git repos?

2016-01-14 18:50:04	grilled-cheese	darkling: depends on your backup strategy, if using your backup system to roll an entire system or directory back is easy, that’s sufficient
2016-01-14 18:50:19	grilled-cheese	a much better one though is to use git + r10k
2016-01-14 18:50:23	darkling	Yeah, that's more or less the case.
2016-01-14 18:50:54	darkling	I'm trying to minimise the number of new tools I need to learn about...

2016-01-14 20:13:00	grilled-cheese	it would appear rhn-channel has a bug of some kind trying to open /dev/tty from the rvm script
2016-01-14 20:13:16	grilled-cheese	so monkeying around with channels manually may fix it after all

2016-01-15 00:08:12	jtreminio	Hi all. I'm using example42/puppet-yum but puppet throws this error: "Error: Could not parse for environment production: Illegal fully qualified name at /vagrant/puphpet/puppet/modules/yum/manifests/repo/10gen.pp:5:18 on node local.barproducts" on URL https://github.com/example42/puppet-yum/blob/master/manifests/repo/10gen.pp
2016-01-15 00:08:25	jtreminio	Any idea what this actually means? Google's not helping much, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem with it

For nginx, when we remove a site from our yaml, it stays alive on our nginx server, we have to remove the config manually. Is there anything we can do about this so when its removed from the yaml, it is also removed from the server?

One thing that bothers me that it should be used by Java application (web service would be more accurate). As I wasn't able to find out any information if mco has some web API, i have few questions. Is it possible to manage mco via puppet api? Is it possible to plug in directly into activemq and manage mco via Stomp? Or is the only way to create wrapper api using ruby/

2016-01-15 11:39:49	agaffney	it's fairly usable and even supports some IRC/irssi commands such as /join, /part, /wc, etc.

2016-01-20 15:21:18	@binford2k	squarebracket: in relation to puppet, what you probably see is that a function returns an rvalue
2016-01-20 15:21:27	agaffney	in the case of pupet, rvalue means that a custom function returns a value
2016-01-20 15:21:34	@binford2k	squarebracket: in other words, content => function(stuff)
2016-01-20 15:21:38	squarebracket	right

2016-01-20 15:21:49	squarebracket	but what ruby / puppet type does that translate to?
2016-01-20 15:21:51	agaffney	the return value can be any supported puppet datatype
2016-01-20 15:21:55	@binford2k	squarebracket: and a param can be anything
2016-01-20 15:21:55	squarebracket	hmm.

2016-01-20 15:22:24	squarebracket	So I _can_ write a custom function which wraps eval(<arbitrary ruby code>) and returns it, and puppet will determine the right type?

2016-01-20 17:00:00	frozenfoxx	rnelson0: it's true, you're not *necessarily* dead in the water if you can spin up VMs in a vsphere environment but then again you're also not dead in the water necessarily if you can get shell on a server.  That said in both cases it's going to depend highly on your setup and specifying that "for mine it's REALLY bad" should suffice.

2016-01-20 17:00:46	frozenfoxx	rnelson0: I do appreciate the concern and will check with my host provider at some point but with how we're doing VMs being able to gain access to do that IS end-game.

2016-01-20 18:13:43	BarnacleBob	ruchlos, it is smart enough to extract what branch the commit was on and deploy that environment.  my module just has a master branch.  i guess i could change it to only have a production branch
2016-01-20 18:14:19	scotje	BarnacleBob: using the webhook endpoint will always try to extract the environment from the hook payload, if your module had branch names that matched the environment names it could work, otherwise you'd have to do something custom with the /deploys endpoint

2016-01-20 18:15:21	BarnacleBob	i just changed the branch names to match and it worked fine.  i'll do that till i need more complicated things

I'm a newbie when it comes to it, but i have used Vagrant, Powershell (a lot), chocolatey (created unattend packages, etc).

2016-01-20 19:07:15	soLucien	so basically my workflow is the following : i commit code to TFS server, the server builds, creates nuget packages, and in the end it creates a chocolatey package that i can use to run unattended installs . At this point, i want to create a few VMs on Hyper-V (i have a PS script that can do that already).

2016-01-20 19:13:05	agaffney	on the Linux side, most people have something in their kickstart config to install puppet
2016-01-20 19:13:18	agaffney	or VM image bootstrap scripts, etc.
2016-01-20 19:13:44	puppetatron	solucien - kickstart is good. I've been using terraform and a combination of scripts with docker
2016-01-20 19:13:45	soLucien	I see. So i should sysprep the image with Puppet installed
2016-01-20 19:13:48	ruchlos	for Windows, I would think you just install the Puppet msi
2016-01-20 19:14:34	puppetatron	we also use custom ami's with puppet preinstalled for our aws stack
2016-01-20 19:14:47	agaffney	soLucien: if you do that, just make sure to remove any certs/keys that puppet may have created, as well as any "certname = " option in puppet.conf

2016-01-20 19:16:16	soLucien	it boots up the first time

2016-01-21 00:01:46	@binford2k	enix: the docs don't specify, but based on the fact that it validates that it's an absolute path, I'm going to guess that it's a local file on the agent

2016-01-21 00:06:12	LeLutin	some users of a module I wrote report errors with the module's usage of puppetlabs' concat module when the future parser is enabled in puppet 3.x but I haven't been able to reproduce this error in puppet 4.x is it possible that the future parser is being too picky about something for which puppet 4 isn't?

2016-01-21 04:57:49	raphink	exec is usually a pretty bad idea/practice
2016-01-21 04:58:01	raphink	there's usually ways to do it better using puppet resources instead
2016-01-21 04:58:13	sam___	how?
2016-01-21 04:58:18	raphink	depends on what your script does :-)
2016-01-21 04:58:35	raphink	that said, if you really want to launch the script and pass variables to it, there's no need for a template

2016-01-21 04:59:48	raphink	Puppet is not a replacement for bash, it's a language ensuring a state
2016-01-21 04:59:56	raphink	yes it is karimb
2016-01-21 05:00:05	karimb	raphink how would you do that ?
2016-01-21 05:00:05	raphink	just use %{::environment} in your levels

2016-01-21 05:00:35	karimb	ah you mean single datadir, and use the environment variable in the hierarchy rather?

2016-01-21 05:07:38	ruchlos	sam___: templates are not scripts so no but you can use file resource to save a file with template source to some location on the agent and use exec to run the resulting thing as a script.
2016-01-21 05:08:03	ruchlos	sam___: but you should really look into using native resources to "install packages" and "modify config files"

I thought flush might be the way to do that but that is per-instance.  Is there a normal way to consolidate multiple changes into one command? e.g. setOption option1=true option2=false option3=false etc instead of setOption option1=true; setOption option2=false …

However, if I install the `gem` package system-wide, it breaks the Puppet package because it uses the system gem vs the packaged gem. I have to re-install all gem libraries system-wide to get Puppet to run. Any workarounds?
2016-01-21 13:01:12	makerops_	Im getting some odd errors mainly, everytime I try to hit the web hook: Code Manager: Not found
2016-01-21 13:01:19	makerops_	but it doesn't look like the normal Jetty error
2016-01-21 13:01:36	makerops_	ie, I think it's something in Code manager saying it's not found

2016-01-21 15:00:12	basic`	question: i have a new install with puppet4 and i'm attempting to manage service puppet, but puppetdb redefines the service before I can apparently hook into it. What is the correct way to ensure puppet is running, enabled and puppetserver is running, enabled with hiera? I can't seem to wrap my head around how to do that

2016-01-21 15:01:03	cprice404	basic`: I think the puppetdb module has a boolean setting that you can use to control whether it tries to manage the puppetserver service
2016-01-21 15:01:08	cprice404	if you set that to false, you can manage it yourself
2016-01-21 15:01:14	basic`	define both services explicitly and do a hiera lookup? using create_resources?
2016-01-21 15:01:28	basic`	oh, does it? i looked at the code and see it checks if it's defined it won't manage it
2016-01-21 15:01:54	rnelson0	puppeteer: you shouldn't need to add the --section part
2016-01-21 15:02:07	basic`	but if i put that in base, the hiera for the puppetserver profile seems to include puppetdb before that service gets included in base
2016-01-21 15:02:14	rnelson0	heck you can just try puppet config print | grep environment

2016-01-21 15:07:35	cprice404	rnelson0: yeah, but "if defined" then relies on the order that your catalog gets populated.  if you have your own code that tries to manage that resource, and the puppetdb module code gets parsed before your other code does, then defined returns false and puppetdb manages it
2016-01-21 15:07:38	rnelson0	or include puppetserver before puppetdb
2016-01-21 15:07:40	basic`	that's just not the parameter i was looking for ;)

Isn't this output in the report equivalent to a 'diff -u' ?

2016-01-21 17:54:46	adfaklsdjf	having an issue with with hiera settings in a yml file getting added to the top of `/etc/php.ini` rather than in their appropriate spot
2016-01-21 17:54:54	adfaklsdjf	so the default is overriding because it's lower in the file
2016-01-21 17:55:12	adfaklsdjf	not sure what docu to read or what google search to run or who to ask ?:(
2016-01-21 17:55:15	tokynet	this is the catalog/agent error

2016-01-21 17:56:43	Noodleboy	Hello everybody.  I'm having a bit of a struggle and am hoping somebody here might see where I'm going wrong.  I'm trying to use service with my own status, but no matter what I set as a status command, it keeps trying to check through systemctl.  I have included hasstatus => false, but that made no difference.  It never runs the commands in my "status =>" line.
2016-01-21 17:56:46	KG4ZOW	that looks like an error within the template itself

2016-01-21 17:57:43	tokynet	KG4ZOW: the file is not really a template... i just put it as a template to try and leverage the unix2dos feature... but this is probably a bad file to try this on

2016-01-21 17:58:34	tokynet	if the default is being applied its usually because it did not find a matching key on hiera adfaklsdjf

2016-01-21 18:01:49	KG4ZOW	it's "content" and "source" which specify filenames differently. the "puppet:///" thing is what you would use with "source =>".

2016-01-21 18:02:49	KG4ZOW	using "content => x" sends the file's contents directly as part of the catalog. using "source => x" sends what amounts to a URL, and then the agent downloads the file after receiving the catalog.
2016-01-21 18:03:18	adfaklsdjf	Noodleboy: So for context I'm using the mayflower/php module, it appears that this module invokes an ini_settings resource type which appears to be inserting my values into the top of the php.ini file.
2016-01-21 18:03:27	KG4ZOW	when you use "content => x", you're able to call functions like unix2dos() or template() in order to build the file's contents.

2016-01-21 18:53:05	tokynet	true BUT
2016-01-21 18:53:28	tokynet	if its possible to pass an array to the file resource to make all of them in 1 resource...
2016-01-21 18:53:50	@binford2k	that's just shorthand for making multiple resources

Does anyone out there have any suggestions I can try out to remedy this?

2016-01-28 16:27:23	jsouza	I imagine there's some kind of prompt appearing that's causing it to hang, but running the raw install command in a powershell doesn't cause the same behavior (Thus the assumption that something is requiring a gui)

2016-02-03 16:17:29	greig	hrm, when implementing https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetserver/latest/external_ssl_termination.html, and having allow-header-cert-info: true, should the puppet servers care if the nodes are source-NATed to a single IP? As I understand it, the servers shouldn't need the IP address to identify/authorize a node because the node's certificate is then passed through in a header.

2016-02-03 19:27:08	iota_pi	Thanks. I'll make a note to make sure the bootstrapper doesn't do that.
2016-02-03 19:27:42	torrancew	for things like server/ca_server should have no impact

2016-02-04 06:21:33	harbie	searched the bug tracker but found nothing relevant - thought i'd check here, maybe it was something I missed. puppet version is 3.7.3

2016-02-04 06:23:03	eslamelhusseiny	hi, I'm trying to create an external hash fact
2016-02-04 06:23:21	eslamelhusseiny	but in validation it says that the fact is string not hash
2016-02-04 06:23:41	eslamelhusseiny	any ideas how to write an external hash fact
2016-02-04 06:24:06	eslamelhusseiny	the fact structure is as following :
2016-02-04 06:24:22	eslamelhusseiny	fact={'a':1,'b':2}

2016-02-04 06:25:41	eslamelhusseiny	I've set stringify_facts to be false as I'm using puppet 3.8
2016-02-04 06:25:59	eslamelhusseiny	and I've tested it against one of the built-in facts and it works fine
2016-02-04 06:26:12	eslamelhusseiny	the output is : false
2016-02-04 06:26:31	Couch	eslamelhusseiny, the text i.e. k=v format doesn't support structured facts
2016-02-04 06:26:41	Couch	you'll need to use either json or yaml types iirc
2016-02-04 06:26:59	eslamelhusseiny	I see, I'll give it a try and feed you back
2016-02-04 06:27:51	Couch	eslamelhusseiny, see https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/2.4/custom_facts.html#structured-data-facts
2016-02-04 06:28:29	Pazzo	@kjetilho, @harbie: that should be easy to reproduce with the given description. Try it this way: puppet apply --certname lb12 -e 'node /^lb[12]$/ { notify { "match": } }'
2016-02-04 06:28:42	harbie	kjetilho: it all boils down to ^lb[12]$ also matching lb12 - which is the wrong behaviour for ruby style regexps
2016-02-04 06:30:20	kjetilho	Pazzo: indeed.  bizarre
2016-02-04 06:30:26	Pazzo	harbie: IMO you should file a bug report, but better use my example from above to explain what's going on - makes it easier to understand
2016-02-04 06:30:32	Pazzo	This is REALLY bizarre
2016-02-04 06:30:58	kjetilho	harbie: workaround: use \Z instead of $
2016-02-04 06:31:01	harbie	roger that

2016-02-04 06:31:55	Pazzo	Yep, \Z works fine

2016-02-04 06:52:53	Beams	I'm having a problem with the PE Console - the web interface is unresponsive. Can't see anything obvious in the logs (but I may be looking in the wrong place). I've tried restarting pe-httpd and pe-console-services, also tried restarting the server. Could anyone give me a hint as to where to start troubleshooting?
2016-02-04 06:53:31	Beams	This happened a couple of days ago so I took a backup of the database, reinstalled (OS and puppet) and restored the database and the problem reocurred so i suspect it could be db related?
2016-02-04 06:54:36	Beams	After the database restore caused the problem again i reinstalled (OS and puppet) again and started from scratch... This is a test box so not much going on on it at the moment. All I've done really is configure r10k and load in some modules, haven't even added any nodes yet.

2016-02-04 11:09:28	jbberry	Dominic: Thanks for the direction. Not sure if it's the "right" fix, but adding "subsystem" to the uniq.reject array in the self.instance does prevent it form removing sshd_config_subsystem defined values. Does require a seperate resource purge statement for sshd_config_subsystem type
2016-02-04 11:10:13	Dominic	jbberry: right, that sounds more correct as it's handled separately, despite being in the same file

2016-02-04 12:50:08	Speedr	chudler: I think it's basically that once you get into a discussion about how the code should do something else, it really requires more of the devs' inputs which means Jira and, if you you have code to contribute to that request, github.  That way it's more than a one on one discussion, it may take longer than IRC but it can be richer
2016-02-04 12:50:30	@binford2k	I didn't see him turned away just now. He was reminded that grouching on here will rarely result in code changes. He's experienced enough to know that was a suggestion to go file a ticket. He was also helped through some debugging, and provided a workaround. What more do you expect?

2016-02-04 12:52:59	Speedr	so back to my issue.  I am unable to find how puppet_enterprise::master::puppetserver:metrics_server_id gets populated, it has no default value in the puppetserver.pp file, no additions to it during the class and no hiera value that I can find...

2016-02-04 12:54:46	Speedr	binford2k: isn't it odd that it states [Integer] in the docs header though? plus how is it being populated now if I didn't specify anything...
2016-02-04 12:55:05	qralston	Anyway, I thought that Puppet's behavior was sub-optimal and/or buggy, and I wanted to see if anyone could tear apart my argument.

2016-02-04 14:47:07	GreyWren	What's the command for making a non-CA puppet server generate a cert for the puppet CA server to sign? I have a puppet server with the CA component turned off, but where do I get the certs to plug into webserver.conf (per https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetserver/2.2/external_ca_configuration.html)
